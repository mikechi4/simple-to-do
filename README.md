This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Simple to do App.

What's the best way to test yourself on a new framework ? A to-do app! I built this just so I can test myself w/ React so far. wanted to take a step back from diving into Redux and solidify my React knowledge. Any tips/advice/best practices would be appreciated !
